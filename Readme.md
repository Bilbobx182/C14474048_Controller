This is the folder for Assignment 3

Controller input graphing tool:

In sports, they often meassure players be it heartbeat, pedometer, distance ran etc etc.I thought wouldn't it be cool to transfer that to video games. 

This will be meassured over a length of a match (In rocket league it's 5 minutes as an example).
It's easy to attribute scoring a goal in soccer as pure luck. It's also easy to say scoring a goal in fifa is pure luck. 
I want to prove otherwise by monitoring what a player does with a controller, I can compare their victories and failures. Their good matches and bad matches
I will be able to tell the difference between what makes someone "pro" and a "novice". From all this data I will be able to create graphs such as a piechart and a barchart.

But it's not meant for just 1 game, I want to be able to apply it to *every* game that has controller support. I feel if I focused too much on 1 game it wouldn't work out as well.

Imagine all the statistics. All the data. Friends in the same game playing different roles would be able to see how they did. How they added to the team unit.
Most importantly how they could do better.
You will probably need the DLL files in the same folder as the jar. I put them in there in case you don't have them.

So enough with the wall of text,here are a few (WIP) screenshots:

![Piechart to Barchart](http://i.imgur.com/ufSiKif.gif )"So this is where things are getting really cool. The user has an option of 4 graphs that they can pick fromThis shows it going from the piechart of that game to the barchart of where they moved their analogue sticks")

![Devs I talked to about this](http://i.imgur.com/adK48S6.png) "I messaged a few developers from game companies that I loved early on in the assignment to see how I could make it better and what they thought Joost from Ronimo who makes awesoemnauts gave really great insight and Thomas Silloway from Psyonix gave a great responce of encouragement too "
