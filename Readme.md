This is the folder for Assignment 3

The best description I can give of it so far:

So. In sports, like rubgy and soccer, they have chips(not your fucking food chips).
These chips monitor what they do; Be it heartbeat, pedometer, distance ran etc etc.
I thought wouldn't it be cool to transfer that to video games. 
This will be meassured over a length of a match (In rocket league it's 5 minutes as an example).
It's easy to attribute scoring a goal in soccer as pure luck. It's also easy to say scoring a goal in fifa is pure luck. 
I want to prove otherwise by monitoring what a player does with a controller, I can compare their victories and failures. Their good matches and bad matches.
Given a certain amount of statistics I should be able to determine if you press X A amount of times you will probably be good or bad. 
I will be able to tell the difference between what makes someone "pro" and a "novice". 
From all this data I will be able to create graphs, piecharts, barcharts,linegraphs. You vs someone who never played as example.

But it's not meant for just 1 game, I want to be able to apply it to *every* game that has controller support.
Imagine all the statistics. All the data. Friends in the same game playing different roles would be able to see how they did. How they added to the team unit.
Most importantly how they could do better.
